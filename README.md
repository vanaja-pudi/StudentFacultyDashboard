# StudentFacultyDashboard
Full-fledged Student-Faculty Dashboard website with complete front-end and back-end. This project was built to provide communication between students and faculty.
Here wa gave logins for both faculty and students. This project helps faculty to post  documents,pdf,class time table and exams time table too.
And here faculty can upload the assigments to particular class by just selecting the class and students can submit their works to a particular faculty within the given time.
So it saves lot of time and faculty can assign the work at anytime from anywhere. Faculty don't need to contact the students personally.
And students will get both collage updates and class updates separetely.

                                You can host our website in localhost with "index.php"
